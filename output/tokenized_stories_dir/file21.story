FIs with better practices would require all customers to declare their tax residency annually . Some would also obtain independent , country-specific legal or tax opinion from tax auditors , lawyers or bankers to confirm the tax-compliance of structures , or tax reporting responsibilities of customers . They would corroborate the customers ' tax declarations against these opinions . Some FIs would also request supporting documents to substantiate the customer 's source of funds or wealth , such as bank statements , recent business accounts filed with relevant authorities , or income tax assessments . A few FIs , subject to customer confidentiality provisions , also coordinated follow-up actions in respect of the tax risk of the same customer within the group to prevent regulatory arbitrage .
