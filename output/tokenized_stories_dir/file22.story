´ staff trading P&P s requiring directors and relevant staff to obtain approval prior to executing personal trades in securities ; all staff are not allowed to trade securities placed on the black lists while staff involved in the relevant CF deals can not trade in securities on the restricted lists ;
´ conducting periodic reviews of staff personal trades to ensure compliance with the firm 's staff trading P&P s ; and
´ prohibiting staff from trading in their personal accounts altogether .
