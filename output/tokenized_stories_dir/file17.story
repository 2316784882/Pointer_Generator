MAS observed from our inspections and engagements with FIs in 2014 that most FIs were still in the process of identifying , assessing and documenting their enterprise-wide ML/TF risks . Further , some FIs had not developed or documented their enterprise-wide ML/TF risk assessment methodologies . Some FIs had not considered the results of Singapore 's National Risk Assessment -LRB- `` NRA '' -RRB- when assessing their enterprise-wide ML/TF risks . Improvements were noted from a subsequent thematic review conducted this year . Many FIs have since identified , assessed and documented the ML/TF risks arising from their business activities and the controls to address these risks .
