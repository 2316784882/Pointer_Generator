The CF firms inspected were generally cognisant of their responsibilities to identify and verify the identities of their customers , natural persons appointed to act on behalf of customers , as well as connected parties and beneficial owners of customers -LRB- collectively referred to as `` relevant persons '' -RRB- . However , some CF firms met these obligations only partially . For instance , some CF firms did not have complete identification information of their customers or natural persons appointed to act on behalf of customers . CF firms are reminded to carry out CDD measures to identify and verify the identities of the relevant persons in a timely and effective manner .
