We also noted from the inspection that some CF firms had conducted verification of the identities of the customers and their beneficial owners a few months after the establishment of business relations with these customers . As set out in paragraph 6.34 of the revised SFA04-N02 , we would like to remind all CF firms to complete such verification measures as soon as reasonably practicable . Paragraph 6-13-2 of the revised Guidelines provide further guidance on the timeline for the completion of such verification measures . Where business relations are established prior to the completion of the verification measures , CF firms should document their reasons for doing so .
