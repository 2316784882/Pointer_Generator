MAS observed a mix of good practices and shortcomings among the CF firms inspected in relation to the screening of relevant persons . Some CF firms did not screen the relevant persons or document the screening results . Under paragraph 6.39 of the revised SFA04-N02 , CF firms are required to screen the relevant persons against the appropriate ML/TF information sources or lists . They should also perform the necessary screening to ensure compliance with the Terrorism -LRB- Suppression of Financing -RRB- Act -LRB- Cap . 325 -RRB- , MAS Regulations issued under section 27A of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act -LRB- Cap . 186 -RRB- and MAS Notice MA-N-EXT 1/2012 -LRB- Prohibition on Transactions with the Iranian Government and with Iranian Financial Institutions -RRB- at all times . Please refer to the new Targeted Financial Sanctions section on the MAS website for more information .
