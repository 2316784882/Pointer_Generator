FIs had performed a tax risk review of their customers when tax crimes were designated as ML predicate offences in Singapore . However , some FIs did not subsequently incorporate tax risk assessment into their P&P s for CDD and ongoing monitoring . All FIs are required to implement effective controls and preventive measures in respect of tax crimes . FIs can employ various measures to assess tax risk , including but not limited to using red - flag indicators to determine if there are any grounds for suspicion that a customer 's assets are proceeds of tax crimes . FIs must also conduct enhanced CDD measures if there is such a suspicion . A suspicious transaction report should be filed where there is knowledge or suspicion of tax crimes . FIs should independently assess whether to establish or continue business relations with a prospective or existing customer where there are reasonable grounds that the customer 's assets are proceeds of tax crimes . If so , FIs should obtain senior management 's approval and document the basis of the decision .
